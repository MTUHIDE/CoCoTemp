                    First, you will need to create an account. To do this click <a href="/cocotemp/register" target="_self">Register</a> and enter your email, a username, and password.
                <p class="getting-started-text">

                <hr />
                <p class="getting-started-text"> Now that you have made your account with CoCoTemp you will need to construct your iButton sensor.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> In order to do this, you will need to get an iButton, a reader, a shield, and optionally an iButton keyfob.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> The shield is needed to protect the iButton from the weather itself. At the same time making sure that the
                    button is consistent temperature by protecting it from the sun, but also giving it access to the air.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> You have multiple options for the shield. You can purchase your shield online or you could create your own shield at home. If you opt to build your own you can refer to our tutorial video below on how to do so, you will just need your iButton, a disposable cup(styrofoam or plastic), some string, an adhesive, and either your reader or keyfob to hold the iButton.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> Here are some links to purchase some of the items you may need.</p>

                    go to <a href="/cocotemp/dashboard" target="_self">My Sites</a>.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> Next, you will want to click on <a href="/cocotemp/dashboard" target="_self">Create a new site</a>.</p>

                <p class="getting-started-text"> From here you will need to give your site a name along with its location. You can set your site's location by
                    clicking on the interactive map, or by entering the latitude, longitude, and elevation.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> The next step is to give it a quick description. This way you will be able to tell which site it is in case you have

                <p class="getting-started-text"> The final section of information to be entered is the globe site survey which asks for information
                    about the location such as the height of the sensor, any obstacles, and other valuable information.
                    You are not required to put all of this information in, but if you do then it will help others when
                    comparing weather data.</p>

                <p class="getting-started-text"> This will take you to a new page where you will be able to select a site and type of device via a drop-down menu. You will
                    also want to put in the manufacturer/serial number so that you can tell the devices apart.</p>

                    display the site's location on the map. In order to delete a device all you need to do is select the device and select delete.

                <hr />
                <p class="getting-started-text"> If you plan to use the CoCo iTemp desktop application to extract and/or upload data from your iButton you will need to install it.
                    This can be downloaded by clicking <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HP9GoeyvDOu5EMzWx4t8fIa9DY64vOG8/view?usp=sharing" target ="_blank">here</a>.
                    In order to run the application you must have java installed, this can be downloaded here <a href = "https://www.java.com/en/download/" target ="_blank">here</a>.
                    You will also need to download the appropriate one-wire drivers so the application can read data from the iButton these can be
                    downloaded <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/one-wire/software-tools/drivers/download-1-wire-ibutton-drivers-for-windows.html"
 target=""_blank >here</a>.</p>
                <p class="getting-started-text"> To obtain iButton data you will need to plug it into your computers USB port via the reader, this must
                    be done before starting the application or it will not detect the iButton. Next, start up the CoCo iTemp application and log into your account.
                     Select the iButton from the dashboard. The iButton's associated site will appear, if the iButton does not have a site associated with it
                    you can click the <b> Assign Site </b> to associate it with one of your sites. Once selected you can have your iButton start collecting data by clicking on the
                    <b>'Mission'</b> button. Next, you can start a new mission by clicking on the <b>'New Mission'</b> button. You can stop a mission
                    by clicking on <b>'Stop Mission'</b>. On the mission page, you can also click on <b>'Read Data'</b> to download the data
                    from your iButton to a local file, this data can then be manually uploaded to the site if you prefer to do it this way.
                    </p>
                <br />
                <p class="getting-started-text"> To upload data make sure that you have your iButton selected and ensure that it has a site assigned to it.
                    You can then click on the <b>'Upload'</b> button and it will upload your data to the desired site.
                    Another way to upload data to a site is to go to the <a href="/cocotemp/upload" target="_self">Upload Data</a> page.
                    Here you can select the file that was generated by clicking on <b>'Read Data'</b> from the iButton and the specific site that you would like to upload it to.
                    You can also add notes to your upload on this page.

                <p class="getting-started-text"> If you are using a different kind of software to obtain your data then make sure that the file you
                    are using to upload is formatted as shown below. A good way to easily make sure of this is to open up your file in Microsoft Excel or a similar software
                    and make sure that it is formatted as shown below. If you have a file that is not a CSV file that you wish to use make sure that you create an Excel file
                    like the example and then you can save the file as a CSV by going to 'save file as' and then changing the file extension type to .csv rather than .xlsx.
