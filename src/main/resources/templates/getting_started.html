                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> In order to do this you will need to get an iButton, a reader, and a shield for the iButton.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> The shield is needed to protect the iButton from the weather itself. At the same time making sure that the
                    button is getting consistent are temperature by keeping it from the sun, but also giving it access to the air.</h4>

                    An easy shield that can be used for example is a plastic/styrofoam cup that is upside down.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> If you do not wish to create your own shield or need something more durable than a plastic cup then you

                    go to <a href="/cocotemp/dashboard" target="_self">"My Sites"</a>.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> Next you will want to click on <a href="/cocotemp/dashboard" target="_self">"Create a new site"</a>.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> From here you will need to give your site a name along with its location. You can set your site's location by
                    using the clicking on the interactive map, or by using entering in the latitude, longitude, and elevation.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> The next step is to give it a quick description. This way you will be able to tell which site it is in case you have
                    many sites.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> The final section of information to be entered is the globe site survey which asks for information
                    about the location such as the height of the sensor, any obstacles, and other valuable information.
                    You are not required to put all of this information in, but if you do then it can possibly help others when
                    comparing weather data.</h4>

                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> Now that you have created a site you will be able to assign devices to it. This is done by clicking

                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> This will take you to a new page where you will be able to select a site and type of device via a drop down menu. You will
                    also want to put in the manufacturer/serial number so that you can tell the devices apart.</h4>
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> Note: the default device type is iButton so if you have a different type of temperature recording device make sure to change this.</h4>
                <br />
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> Once you have created a site and a device you can select them from <a href="/cocotemp/dashboard" target="_self">"My Sites"</a>
                     to view information about them such as the metadata and what devices are assigned to the site. When viewing a site
                    it will also display a graph above of all of its current data that you have put in so far, and to the side it will
                    display the site's location on the map. In order to delete a device all you need to do is select the device and select delete.

                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> To use the iButton you will need to plug it into your computers usb port. Next start up the CoCoITemp application and log into your account.
                     Select the iButton from the selection screen. Once selected you can have your iButton start collecting data by clicking on the
                    <b>'Mission'</b> button. Next you can start a new mission by clicking on 'Start Mission' and you can stop a mission
                    by clicking on <b>'Stop Mission'</b>. On the mission page you can also click on <b>'Read Data'</b> to download the data
                    from your iButton to a local file.

                <br />
                <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 200px"> To upload data make sure that you have your iButton selected and on the selection screen there is a button that you can click on called
                    <b>'Edit Site'</b>. This allows you to assign the iButton to a site. This way when you click on the <b>'Upload'</b>
                    Button it will upload your data to the desired site. Another way to upload data to a site is to go to the
                    <a href="/cocotemp/upload" target="_self">"Upload Data"</a> page. Here you can select the file that you pulled from the iButton and the
                    specific site that you would like to upload it to. You can also add notes to your upload.

                    are using to upload is formatted as shown below. A good way to easily make sure of this is to open up your file in Microsoft Excel or a similar software,
                    and make sure that it is formatted the also as shown below. If you have a file that is not a csv file that you wish to use make sure that you create an Excel file
                    like the example and then you can save the file as a CSV by going to 'save file as' and then changing the file extension type to .csv rather than .xlsx.

                     page. Once here you can load NOAA sites based off of custom filters using the filters tab on the right side of the screen. Once you have all
                     of the desired sites loaded you can click on them and then click on <b>'Add to Graph'</b>. If you want to remove something from the graph
                     then re-click them on the graph and click <b>'Remove from Graph'</b>. Once you select a site the data will appear on the graph below and also
                     in tables in the filter tab on the right.

                    Another thing to note is that the yellow lines on the graph are there to indicate large drops or rises in temperature which could help locate any suspect data.
